-------
### **Discovery**

**When**: July 11, 1925

**Who**: John Alison Dingle

**How**: 
- John Dingle was just an average guy, surfing at his local beach on a sunny day in July of 1925. 

- Suddenly he caught an agressive wave that shoved him underwater. John was rapidly dragged out to sea and far away from shore. 

- John got lost so he tried to paddle back to what he thought was his beach.

- Although, the land he ended up on was an unmarked island people had yet to discover.

- This island was the one of the most beautiful things John had ever seen. Eventually John was rescued and returned home.

- Sense John discovered the island, he had the right to own it. Ever since then, John worked hard to make it something even greater.

**More Facts**:
- The island is named after John's wife, Trunia Izzy Dingle. When John saw the the beauty of the island, it made him think of his wife. 

- In 1940, Trunia Island gained popularity quickly due to the island being in the direct path of a total solar eclipse. 

- In 1942, a species of flower was found that exists no where else. The flower was named the Josephine flower after the founder, Josephine Jarvis.
